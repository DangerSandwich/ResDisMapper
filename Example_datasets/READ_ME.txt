The .gen and .coordinates files contain the genetic and geographical data, respectively, for sampled individuals in the two empirical datasets (files with the names "Pigeons" and "Sifakas") and the SimAdapt simulated dataset (files with names corresponding to the SimAdapt scenarios simulated, as per Table S1 of Tang et al.).

The .txt files define the two types of landscape for the SimAdapt simulations, one with a single barrier (files with "SingleBarrierLandscape" in the names) and one with a double barrier (files with "DoubleBarrierLandscape" in the names). The files with "barrier_file" in the names give the coordinates of each cell together with values of the barrier parameter. In addition, the files with "resource_file" in the names give the coordinates of each cell together with values of the resource parameter. Furthermore, the files with "type_file" in the names give the coordinates of each cell together with a number representing the type of each cell (a barrier or a non-barrier).
